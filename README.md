# PneumoAI
This project applies deep learning techniques to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images. Using PyTorch and a pretrained ResNet model, the system classifies images as either NORMAL or PNEUMONIA. The dataset is split into training and test sets, and includes preprocessing, augmentation, model training, and evaluation.
